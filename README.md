# Shader-Resources

I will be adding resources for making P5.js shaders to this respository.

I am relying heavily on the following resourses:

- The website of Inigo Quilez https://iquilezles.org 
and his youtube tutorials https://www.youtube.com/c/InigoQuilez

- The Art of Code tutorials on Youtube by Martijn Steinrucken.
